# CV-API-Sample
Example iOS App using the Computer Vision API from Blippar

## Introduction

You should have read the [Computer Vision](https://developer.blippar.com/portal/vs-api/api-documentations/) documentation before anything else. This app does nothing but a request to the API and prints the results in the console.

## Usage

**Open CV-API-Sample.xcodeproj** and **edit the CV-API.plist** file with your own ID and Secret :

~~~
<key>client_id</key>
<string>xxx</string>
<key>client_secret</key>
<string>xxx</string>
~~~

Then simply **Run the project.**
